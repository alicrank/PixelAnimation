# The Pixel Project
Miss. Crank shall update this with a nice description, and add/update the todo.
### Todo
 - [ ] Merge the webapp to allow camera control of Pixel
 - [ ] Levels and difficulty
	- spawn a “poison” like chocolate that makes her move very slow
	- spawn more vacuums with the player’s time
	- new levels can be generated at random using 
	
 - [ ] Customisation and re-visibility
	- allow user to select glow color of the ball
	- change in glow color, yields a different background color scheme :)
